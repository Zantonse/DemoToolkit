# Okta SE Toolkit - Environment Variables
#
# This project does NOT require environment variables for operation.
# Credentials are stored client-side in browser localStorage.
#
# This file exists for documentation purposes only.
#
# If you wish to implement server-side credential storage in the future,
# you could use these environment variable patterns:
#
# OKTA_ORG_URL=https://your-org.okta.com
# OKTA_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
#
# However, the current implementation intentionally uses client-side storage
# for simplicity in single-user SE deployments.
